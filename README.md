# Vending-Machine-FSM
A vending machine controller is implemented using a finite state machine (FSM) in VHDL. The design takes inputs representing different coin values and outputs signals for item dispensing and change return. The FSM is simulated in Quartus using the University Program Waveform function to verify correct operation.
